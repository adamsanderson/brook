# Brook

Brook is a simple feed reader built to work with webext compatible browser extensions.  At the moment,
this means Firefox since it's the primary browser I use that supports the sidebar API.

## Development

To start developing, run:

```
yarn install
yarn build # In one terminal
yarn start # In another terminal
```

To see debugging messages in Firefox, use the `Browser Console`.  To debug the extensions, use the `Browser Toolbox`.
