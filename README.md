# Brook

Brook is a simple feed reader built to work with webext compatible browser extensions.  At the moment,
this means Firefox since it's the primary browser I use that supports the sidebar API.

## Development

To start developing, run:

```
yarn install
yarn build # In one terminal
yarn start # In another terminal
```

To see debugging messages in Firefox, use the `Browser Console`.  To debug, use the `Browser Toolbox`, 
or visit `about:debugging` and click the `debug` button.

To access special debugging menus, shift click the primary menu.

## Development Status and Priorities

This project exists primarily to let me read my feeds in Firefox.  I have done my best to make it a pleasant
experience, but have not applied the rigor I might in a professional context.  Sorry, as a dad, I write this
in my odd hours once the family sleeps, and although important, joyous functionality trumps all else in the
wee hours of the night.
